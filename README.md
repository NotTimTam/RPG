# rUNTIME pYTHON gAME (R.P.G)
*The Python Terminal RPG*

## Meet the Team
* TimTam (NotTimTam) - Programming and Software Design.
* Crow (pcperkins) - Programming and Structure.
* Katie (KatieHuntressDevAcc) - Story and World Design.

## Installation
R.P.G was created using Python 3.8.5, to run it you need to install Python 3.X, preferably 3.8 or newer. It should work with older versions of Python 3.X, but there may be issues if you don't update to the latest version.

R.P.G was created with the Microsoft Windows operating system in mind. If you have any issues running it on other operating systems please do not hesitate to let us know.

Before you can start playing, you must install the software's dependencies. On windows this would consist of opening the Command Prompt, using cd to navigate to the RPG folder the files are contained in and run this command:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

After all of the required packages have been installed, simply run main.py and start playing! Entering commands is as simple as typing them in and hitting enter.

## Extra Notes
We can't wait to see what the community does with what we've made! However, until we have a stable base game with the core features we want, we won't be accepting any community made modifications into the main repo. After the game is out of its alpha stage, we will definitely be including community features we find interesting!
