# Runtime Python Game
## The Python Terminal RPG

## Dependencies
R.P.G was created using Python 3.8.5, to run it you need to install Python 3.X, preferably 3.8 or newer. It should work with older versions of Python 3.X, but there may be issues if you don't update to the latest version.

If you don't run R.P.G. inside of our virtual system, you'll need to make sure you have all of the required external packages. Most of the packages that R.P.G uses are included with standard installations of Python. However, there are a few that need to be installed using [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

Here is a list of all packages that are required, ones marked in bold are not included with Python 3.8.5.

- json
- os
